    <h4>Build forms right from your browser</h4>
    <p> One important component of Expedite is Form Builder, a web app which allows you to visually                    design forms. With Form Builder, you can create and deploy forms in minutes, right from a web                    browser. There is no need for any additional client software or plugins. </p>

</div>
<div>
  <div>
    <h4>Your web forms, accessible anywhere</h4>
    <p> The forms you create in Form Builder are web forms. They are implemented using standard web                    technologies and can be accessed from desktops, laptops and mobile devices. </p>

  <div>
    <h4>Validation, visibility, calculations, and branching</h4>
    <p> With Form Builder, you can define validation rules for your form fields, specifying errors,                    warnings, and alert messages to display. You can also define whether fields are visible or editable                    by users, and create rules to automatically calculate and populate their values, for example based                    on other fields. And all this logic runs in the background, as users interact with your                    forms, providing them with immediate feedback. </p>

</div>
<div>
  <div>
    <h4>Repeating sections and tables</h4>
    <p> Form Builder allows you to create forms where a group of fields can be repeated. For example to                    create a form for users to provide information about their children, with for instance a name,                    gender, birth date, social security number, etc. You can also set a minimum and maximum numbers of                    children allowed, and the form will allow users to add children until the maximum is reached. </p>

  <div>
    <h4>Generate PDF, automatically or from a template</h4>
    <p> Expedite can generate PDF files with the data entered by your users. The PDF can be generated                    automatically based on a layout of the web form created in Form Builder. A PDF can also be generated                    from a PDF template, which you provide to Form Builder, in which case Expedite will populate                    the form fields in PDF template with data entered by users in the web form. </p>

</div>
<div>
  <div>
    <h4>Multi-page forms</h4>
    <p> Out of the box, each form can be presented as a beautiful multi-page form with navigation so that                    your users are not overwhelmed by large forms. You can easily see which form page contains errors,                    and quickly jump from the error list to the appropriate page. </p>
